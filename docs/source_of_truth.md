# Philosophical Multi-Agent Debate System - Source of Truth

This document serves as the source of truth for the Philosophical Multi-Agent Debate System project, tracking all files, their purposes, and project structure.

## Project Overview

A multi-agent AI system that simulates philosophical debates between different philosophical personas. The system takes user prompts about philosophical topics, analyzes them through multiple philosophical lenses, facilitates debate between the philosophical agents, and provides a synthesized summary of the different viewpoints. 

### Key Features (Current)
- **Dynamic Agent Loading:** All debate and judge agents are defined in markdown files and loaded at runtime from `agent_definitions/` and `judge_definitions/`.
- **Debate Flow:** Canonical debate protocol is Opening Statement → Rebuttal → Closing Statement → Summarization → Judging.
    - **Closing Statement:** After rebuttals, each agent receives their worldview, opening, and all rebuttals against them, and generates a closing statement. This phase is parallelized and configurable via `PARALLEL_AGENTS_CLOSING`. See `orchestrator_dynamic.py` for details.
- **Summarizer Agent:** Summaries are generated by a single, non-evaluative summarizer agent defined in `summarizer_definitions/Summarizer.md`. The summarizer only restates the points and arguments for each agent, with no evaluative or opinionated language.
- **Judging:** Judge agents (from `judge_definitions/`) vote using only the agent summaries, not the full transcript. Each judge uses a distinct, editable prompt and quorum logic is enforced (must be odd number of judges).
- **Parallelization:** All LLM calls for each phase (openings, rebuttals, summarization) are parallelized according to the `PARALLEL_AGENTS` environment variable. Phases remain sequential.
- **Transcript & Logging:** Full debate transcript, agent summaries, judge votes, and rationales are logged for transparency.
- **Extensible:** New agents and judges can be added by creating new markdown files. Summarizer and judge prompts are editable for custom debate/judging styles.
- **No legacy/static agents:** All agent lists and judging logic are dynamic and file-driven.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: Autogen for multi-agent orchestration
- **LLM Backend**: OpenAI API (configurable)
- **UI**: Initially CLI, potentially web-based in the future

│   │   ### Per-Phase Parallelism (2025-06)
│   │   - You can now set the maximum number of parallel prompts for each debate phase via environment variables:
│   │     - `PARALLEL_AGENTS_OPENING`, `PARALLEL_AGENTS_REBUTTAL`, `PARALLEL_AGENTS_SUMMARY`, `PARALLEL_AGENTS_JUDGING`
│   │   - If a phase-specific variable is unset, the system uses the value of `PARALLEL_AGENTS` as fallback.
│   │   - This is essential for LLM providers with limited context/KV cache: use a lower value for summary/judging phases to avoid overflow, while keeping higher parallelism for opening/rebuttal.
│   │   - See `src/agents/orchestrator_dynamic.py` for implementation details.

## Documentation

- `docs/agent_specifications.md`: Documents the concept that each agent embodies a distinct philosophical archetype, along with their core responsibilities: analyzing user prompts, critiquing other agents, and contributing to a debate summary.
- `docs/implementation_plan.md`: References the philosophical archetype agent structure and describes how this is implemented in code, ensuring alignment with the specifications.
- `docs/persistent_memory.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the memory system architecture, features, and usage.
- `docs/dynamic_agent_system.md`: Documentation for the dynamic agent loading system from individual agent definition files. 
- **Dynamic agent loading**: Agents are loaded at runtime from the `agent_definitions/` directory using `agent_loader.py`.
- **Judge agent loading**: Judge agents are loaded at runtime from the `judge_definitions/` directory using `judge_loader.py`. Each judge has a distinct prompt and only receives agent summaries for voting.
- **Summarizer agent**: The summarizer agent is defined in `summarizer_definitions/Summarizer.md` and is strictly non-evaluative. It generates factual, non-opinionated summaries for each agent, which are then used by the judges.
- **Debate protocol**: The canonical orchestrator (`orchestrator_dynamic.py`) runs debates in four phases: Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Summarization, and Judging. All LLM calls for each phase are parallelized according to the `PARALLEL_AGENTS` environment variable.
- **Token usage tracking**: The `token_usage.py` module tracks and reports token usage per agent, per phase, and per debate. Usage logs are stored in `memory/token_usage/` as JSON files keyed by debate ID. The tracker can be used to log, load, and summarize token usage across debates.
- **Agent methods**: Dynamic agents support `opening_statement` and `rebuttal` methods for new debate phases, falling back to `analyze_prompt` and `critique` for legacy compatibility. Agent definitions can provide explicit prompts for these phases.
- `docs/project_structure.md`: Detailed documentation of the project structure with directory tree and file descriptions.
- `README.md`: The Project Overview section states the multi-agent debate concept, agent archetypes, responsibilities, and summary output.
- `docs/task_breakdown.md`: Updatable, structured breakdown of all project tasks, designed for both human and AI coding assistants.

## Review Log

- **June 9, 2025:** Reviewed all agent, summarizer, and judge definition files in `agent_definitions/`, `summarizer_definitions/`, and `judge_definitions/`. Confirmed they are well-structured, detailed, and meet project requirements for distinct personas and roles, suitable for the target LLM (Gemma3 27B IT). No content changes made to definitions as they are currently of high quality and align with project goals.

*Note: This document will be updated as files are created, modified, or deleted.*

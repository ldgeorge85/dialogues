# Philosophical Multi-Agent Debate System - Agent Specifications

## Philosophical Archetype Concept
Each agent in this system embodies a distinct philosophical archetype (e.g., Stoic, Utilitarian, Existentialist, etc.). These archetypes guide the agent’s reasoning style, critique methods, and debate contributions, ensuring diverse perspectives.

## Agent Responsibilities
- **Analyze User Prompts:** Each agent interprets and responds to user prompts through the lens of its philosophical archetype.
- **Critique Peer Analyses:** Agents review and critique the responses of other agents, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and philosophical disagreements.
- **Debate Summary Contribution:** Each agent may contribute to a final summary, or a dedicated summarizer agent synthesizes the debate for the user.
